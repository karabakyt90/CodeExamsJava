Automation Demo Framework for saucedemo.com


### Prerequisites

Make sure to have these tools in your framework:
```
java
maven
cucumber
pom.xml
JUnit
POM design pattern
```
### Why these tools?


```
Java is my core programming language
Maven centralizes all my dependencies, which is easy to control the version of the tools that I am using.
Cucumber generates HTML report, even non-technical people can understand the flow of the automation.
JUnit is used for assertions.
POM design pattern: where I stored all the webelements for Webstaurantstore_page


```
